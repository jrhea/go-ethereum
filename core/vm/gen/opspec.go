// This file holds the generator's opcode model: which tier each opcode is
// dispatched by, and the per-opcode spec derived from the per-fork jump tables.
//
// Two things decide a tier and they are kept apart. tierFor answers what the
// generator can safely emit: an opcode whose gas or stack bounds vary by fork
// cannot have them written out as constants, and a handler built by a closure has
// no name to write a call to. hotOps defines what is worth emitting.
//
// A case saves a fixed amount per execution, the indirect call through the table
// and the metering around it, so what it buys is that saving times the count, as
// a share of the time the opcode spends. A cheap opcode pays the overhead on top
// of very little work, so the share is large, while an expensive one absorbs it.
// Frequent low-gas opcodes are the ones worth a case. Against that, the switch is
// one large function competing for a 32KB L1 instruction cache, so a case that
// rarely runs still pushes the hot ones further apart.

// tier is how the dispatch handles one opcode.
